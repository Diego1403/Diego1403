# 👋 Hi there! I'm Diego



👨‍💻 My main areas of interest are AI and web development, and I enjoy working on projects that involve both. I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize the web and make it more intelligent and user-friendly.

🚀 When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading about the latest trends in tech, or playing video games.

🌟 Feel free to check out my Github repositories to see what I've been working on lately. If you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out!
